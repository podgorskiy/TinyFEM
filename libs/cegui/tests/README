REGRESSION TESTS
===============================================================================

This folder contains regression tests of the CEGUI library.

The whole system uses boost::test as a driving framework with several custom
additions for performance testing. This doesn't mean you have to get boost to
use CEGUI! You only need boost to run the test suite which you likely aren't
going to need.

Coverage
===============================================================================
We are not aiming for 100% coverage! CEGUI wasn't developed with tests
initially and it would be very hard to get everything covered at this point.

However tests will be gradually added and we plan to maintain and keep them
around from now on. They should help us make bigger changes with more
confidence and potentially point out issues we wouldn't have known about
otherwise.

Performance
===============================================================================
Part of this suite are performance tests of various CEGUI parts. Comparing data
across PCs and even environments on the same PC is ridiculous! These should
only serve to assess performance implications when changing CEGUI core code and
the raw time data should only be compared between runs on the same PC, same OS,
same environment.
